/* 

I created this project while learning about data types, constants, and basic input/output in C++. In this program, the user can enter the number of cars they want to get cleaned, and the program will calculate the estimated cost of cleaning.
The output looks something like this:
   

vedant's car Cleaning Service     

Number of small cars: 3
Number of large cars: 1
Price per small car: $25
Price per large car: $35
Cost : $110
Tax: $6.6
===============================
Total estimate: $116.6
